### Digit-Classification
This is a classifier built for my Artificial Intelligence class.

I have created the following features for classification:
Feature 1: Using the Pixel values of the image.
Feature 2: I have used a modified Tarjan algorithm (DFS) for strongly connected components algorithm for computing contiguous regins.
Feature 3: Calculation of blank pixels between two solid pixel.

Implemented using 
- Python
